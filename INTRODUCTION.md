# Introduction

The purpose of this file is to give a brief explanation of my implementation.

## Library Added
- react-router-dom
- react-hook-form
- little-state-machine

## At First Glance
- The provided wireframe and routing instructions suggested that we have different pages (separate forms/components/content) because we have different routes, so react-hook-form and react-router-dom were added.

- In addition, for state management, little-state-machine was added. This library is a simple state management library, lightweight and greate for managing local component state.

- For the API call, simple JavaScript fetch was used, only calling 2 api calls, I did not want to add additional dependencies.

- For styling, plain old css was used, i did not want to add additional dependencies, just kept it simple and followed the wireframe.
